# Image-to-Line-Draw-Using-Raspberry-Pi-4
This study brings together embedded systems with art. The focus of this study is to capture an image from the camera module (Picamera2) with Raspberry Pi 4, which is then further converted into a LineDraw image. This image is then converted into a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file so that it can be printed on a surface or paper using an AxiDraw Pen plotter. The conversion of an image to a line drawn image is carried out using a Line Draw Algorithm, along with background removal techniques for enhanced visual clarity. For this case study, a global shutter camera is used to capture the images from the surroundings which can be saved in the system. The image is then converted into an SVG in Raspberry Pi. This SVG file is then opened in Inkscape software to further print the image in an Axidraw Pen plotter. A GUI was created to bring all these functions together on a single window, for a better user-friendly experience where the user can run through the entire process from the same window. There were some issues regarding the Raspberry Pi, Picamera, display, and GUI which were all resolved in the end. This study brought together edge image processing, embedded control, and robotics, presenting a more effective system blend of art and technology.
